        addresses indicated by both parties. Notices will be deemed delivered on the date shown on the postal return

        provisions will remain in full force and effect and the parties will amend the agreement to give effect to
        the stricken clause to the maximum extent possible. No waiver of any breach of this agreement will be a

        authorized representative of the waiving party. Apart from the payment of any amounts due, neither party
        shall be liable for performance delays or for non performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control.

    <p><b>Note:</b> LogMeIn (LMI) Rescue is a 3rd party remote assistance product that is currently used to provide
      remote support to Computer Solutions East customers. Computer Solutions East support uses the Enterprise
      version of LogMeIn Rescue as the primary Remote Desktop Assistance tool to troubleshoot and resolve customer
      issues.</p>

    <p>With LogMeIn Rescue, Computer Solutions East support engineers can view or share control of the remote
      computer, chat, and highlight sections of the customer’s screen without the need to pre-install software.</p>

    <p>LogMeIn Rescue differs from other remote access products from LogMeIn and other companies in that it is a
      reactive, permission-based support tool. No permanent software is installed on customer’s PC/device in order
      to deliver support that requires remote access, and Computer Solutions East support engineers can only
      remotely access a Computer Solutions East customer’s PC with that customer’s explicit permission – permission
      that must be granted each and every time a customer requests support. Support from Computer Solutions East
      will be initiated from this site only.</p>

    <p>This product information should not be considered an endorsement or support by Computer Solutions East.
      Computer Solutions East may discontinue use of this tool without prior notice.</p>
